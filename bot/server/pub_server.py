    Note that with ZMQ (libzmq) >= 3.0, only topics that are actually
    subscribed to will be published. In other words, topic filtering
    happens here, at the publisher. This saves bot resources, so it's
    strongly suggested that ZMQ >= 3.0 is used.

    The PubServer is a thread, and is meant to be spawned by CtrlServer.

    CtrlServer passes a dict of the bot's systems to PubServer when it's
    created, which gives PubServer access to the state of the bot.

    Note that the "ir" topic isn't quite a read-only operation, as it
    must cycle through ADCs and actually use the IR sensors. If the bot
    is following line, it's likely a bad idea to publish this topic.
    Using ir_cached is an alternative, as it will returned cached IR
    values if the are fresher than some given staleness (defaults to
    one second). This could still cause problems, but it's less likely.
