 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2x32/G2x52 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A1 32x, AVcc, TA0 Trig, DCO
//
//  Description; A1 is sampled in 32x burst using DTC 16 times per second
//  (ACLK/2048) with reference to AVcc. Activity is interrupt driven.
//  Timer_A in upmode uses TA0 toggle to drive ADC10 conversion. Sample burst
//  is automatically triggered by TA0 rising edge every 2048 ACLK cycles.
//  ADC10_ISR will exit from LPM3 mode and return CPU active. Internal ADC10OSC
//  times sample (16x) and conversion (13x). DTC transfers conversion code to
//  RAM 200h - 240h. In the Mainloop P1.0 is toggled. Normal Mode is LPM3.
//  //* An external watch crystal on XIN XOUT is required for ACLK *//
