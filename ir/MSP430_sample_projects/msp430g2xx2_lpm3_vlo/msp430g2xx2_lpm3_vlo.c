 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2xx2 Demo - Basic Clock, LPM3 Using WDT ISR, VLO ACLK
//
//  Description: This program operates MSP430 normally in LPM3, pulsing P1.0
//  ~ 6 second intervals. WDT ISR used to wake-up system. All I/O configured
//  as low outputs to eliminate floating inputs. Current consumption does
//  increase when LED is powered on P1.0. Demo for measuring LPM3 current.
//  ACLK = VLO/2, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO
//
