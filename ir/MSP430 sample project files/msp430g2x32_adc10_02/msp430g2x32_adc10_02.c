 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2x32/G2x52 Demo - ADC10, Sample A1, 1.5V Ref, Set P1.0 if > 0.2V
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A1 with reference to internal
//  1.5V Vref. Software sets ADC10SC to start sample and conversion - ADC10SC
//  automatically cleared at EOC. ADC10 internal oscillator times sample (16x)
//  and conversion. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0 to save power until ADC10
//  conversion complete, ADC10_ISR will force exit from any LPMx in Mainloop on
//  reti. If A1 > 0.2V, P1.0 set, else reset.
//
