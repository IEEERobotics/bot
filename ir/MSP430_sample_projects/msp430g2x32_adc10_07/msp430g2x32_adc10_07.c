 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430G2x32/G2x52 Demo - ADC10, DTC Sample A1 32x, AVcc, Repeat Single, DCO
//
//  Description: Use DTC to sample A1 32 times with reference to AVcc. Software
//  writes to ADC10SC to trigger sample burst. In Mainloop MSP430 waits in LPM0
//  to save power until ADC10 conversion burst complete, ADC10_ISR(DTC) will
//  force exit from any LPMx in Mainloop on reti. ADC10 internal oscillator
//  times sample period (16x) and conversion (13x). DTC transfers conversion
//  code to RAM 200h - 240h. P1.0 set at start of conversion burst, reset on
//  completion.
