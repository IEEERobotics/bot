    Line *Interface*, are used by agents like humans to interact
    with the bot. For interfaces to communicate with the bot, they
    own clients (like CtrlClient and SubClient), which know how to
    speak ZMQ to the servers (like CtrlServer and PubServer) running on
    the bot. Servers own systems (like gunner and driver) and known how
    to fire commands off to those systems and/or share data about their

        We're not using a logger or config here to reduce dependencies.

        CtrlClient is used for sending commands to the bot. Some commands,
        like `ping`, are answered by CtrlClient directly. Others, like
        `fire`, are actually exported methods that CtrlClient exposes
        via the API. Those calls are passed to the relevant method of a
        system owned by CtrlClient.

        SubClient manages subscriptions to topics published by PubServer
        on the bot. Topics can be subscribed to via `sub_add` and removed
        via `sub_del`. To print the data being published, use `sub`.
        Only topics that are actually subscribed to by one or more clients
        will be published by PubServer, saving bot resources. Note that
        PubServer isn't spawned by default when CtrlServer is created.
